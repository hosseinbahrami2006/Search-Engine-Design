# Search-Engine-Design
This project works by running the app file. 
However, to execute this project, you need Python and libraries such as Flask, Pandas, OS, Sklearn, and NumPy.

After running the app, you can enter this link: http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser 
to access the search engine interface.

In fact, project_tfidf2 is the core of this search engine, 
and to improve the search process, only this file needs to be optimized.

Please note that the dataset used in this project has been taken from the valuable and useful 
website https://www.whatshouldireadnext.com , and the search is conducted exclusively on this dataset.
